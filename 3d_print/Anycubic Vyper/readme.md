[PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/page/prusaslicer_424/) seems the best to date 3D slicing software. However, the steeings for Anycubic Vyper are not supported/published for it.
These files are empitic attempt to reuse currect settings for optimal slicing/printing with the PrusaSlicer.

As reported [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anycubic/comments/t6e7jd/anycubic_vyper_configuration_for_prusaslicer_rare/) and [here](https://github.com/ANYCUBIC-3D/Vyper/issues/18) Anycubic Vyper firmware version 2.4.5 has no support of linear advance. This causes overextrusion on corners. As workaround, the print speed is reduced to annoying slow rate. This minimize thus not eliminates the overextrusion.

Anyway until the linear advance is implemente in Anycubic Vyper, this is the best possible configuration to the moment. Improvements are welcome!
